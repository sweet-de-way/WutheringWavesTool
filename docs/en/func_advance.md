#### About the Game Launch Programs

There are two launch programs for Wuthering Waves:

```
Wuthering Waves\Wuthering Waves Game\Wuthering Waves.exe
```

and

```
Wuthering Waves\Wuthering Waves Game\Client\Binaries\Win64\Client-Win64-Shipping.exe
```

The assistant will default to launching the game with Wuthering Waves.exe. The choice of DX version for the launch program depends on your computer's configuration. If you need to specify it, please select it through the launch parameters.

> If you want to use the launch parameter feature, please select "Custom" and set it to Client-Win64-Shipping.exe (the current version of the assistant has already set this; no changes are necessary unless needed).
